# Tailwind as A Vite Plugin

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/pixel-perfect-figma-to-tailwind/preparing-for-tailwind-v4/integrating-tailwind-v4-with-vite" />

👨‍💼 Tailwind CSS v4 will still be available as a PostCSS plugin (as it is today), but there's also a new option to use it as a Vite plugin.

👨‍💼 Since we're working in a Vite app already... let's give it a try!

## Update dependencies

🧝‍♂️ I've gone ahead and installed the alpha version of Tailwind CSS v4 in this app:

```diff filename=package.json
- "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0",
+ "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0-alpha.14",
```

🧝‍♂️ I have also installed the Tailwind Vite plugin:

```diff filename=package.json
"devDependencies": {
+  "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.0.0-alpha.14",
  "@types/node": "^20.9.1",
```

🧝‍♂️ Finally, I've removed both the `postcss` and `autoprefixer` dependencies — we don't need those anymore!

```diff filename=package.json
- "autoprefixer": "^10.4.16",
- "postcss": "^8.4.31",
```

## Update the Tailwind Intellisense vscode extension

💰 To get all the Tailwind Intellisense goodness in vscode, you need to switch to the pre-release version of the extension in vscode:

## Configure the Vite plugin

🐨 In the <InlineFile file='vite.config.ts' />, import the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin and register it in the `plugins` array.

## Remove the PostCSS config file

The Vite plugin version of Tailwind CSS v4 is _not_ a PostCSS plugin. We've also removed PostCSS from our dependencies, so let's remove the PostCSS config file.

🐨 Delete <InlineFile file='postcss.config.mjs' />.

## Update the CSS file

Currently, the <InlineFile file='src/styles/tailwind.css' /> uses `@tailwind` PostCSS directives.

BUT — we're not using PostCSS anymore! Instead, we're going to use a regular CSS import, and import the Tailwind CSS syles like so:

```css filename=src/styles/tailwind.css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

🐨 Update the <InlineFile file='src/styles/tailwind.css' /> file to make _some of_ the Tailwind styles work on the app once again.
