# Theme Customisation in CSS

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/pixel-perfect-figma-to-tailwind/preparing-for-tailwind-v4/customize-the-tailwind-theme" />

👨‍💼 Our app is _sort of_ working, but there are obviously some styles missing.

🦉 It's important to understand that the `tailwind.config.ts` file is completely ignored in Tailwind CSS v4. It will eventually be supported for the stable release, but right now, it's being ignored.

👨‍💼 Ahaaa, **that's** why! Well, we need to port our theme customisations to the CSS file, then!

## Customise the Tailwind theme in CSS

Tailwind CSS v4 lets you extend (or override) the default theme by using CSS variables directly in your CSS.

💰 Let me show you an example for the custom `highlight` color we had defined in the Tailwind config.

What looks like this in `tailwind.config.ts`...

```ts
theme: {
 extend: {
  colors: {
   highlight: '#6202FF',
  }
 }
}
```

... can be defined like that in the `styles.css` file:

```css
@theme {
	--color-highlight: #6202ff;
}
```

💰 The Intellisense should give you suggestions for available CSS variables names in the theme.

- `--color-{name}` will let you define a color value.
- `--breakpoint-{name}` will let you define a screen size value.
- `--font-family-{name}` will let you define a font-family value.

🦉 Here's an exhaustive list of [all the Tailwind theme CSS variables](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/next/packages/tailwindcss/theme.css) available.

## Let's get to work

🐨 Transfer over the <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.ts" /> theme customisations for `screens`, `colors` and `font-family` to the <InlineFile file="src/styles/tailwind.css" /> file.
