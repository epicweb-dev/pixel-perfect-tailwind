👨‍💼 I know I repeat myself, but... make the list of logos look like the [design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=285%3A1631&mode=design&t=Uz4PrzNet0bziaOa-1) 😅

## Wrapping list

🐨 Implement the correct `gap`, `max-width` and alignment on the `ul` element, according to the Figma specs.

💰 For the `max-width`, you need to look at larger screens on the design. Since we might be previewing our design on larger viewports, it's nice to already have the correct `max-width` set up, so it doesn't look ridiculously wide.

💰 Since the tiles seem to be flowing line by line and wrapping, you probably want to look into using [📜 flex-wrap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-wrap) on that `ul` element.

## Logo tile

🐨 Apply the logo tile styles on the `a` element, based on the Figma design.

👨‍💼 Pay attention to the size, background opacity, border-radius and all!

💰 To center the logo inside the tile, you can use make the `a` tag a `grid`, and used our now best friend [📜 place-items](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/place-items#center) property.
