# Structural Layout

Our markup needs to be wrapped in a couple of layout containers:

- a **full-page container** responsible for centering the whole design in the viewport
- a **layout grid** that manages the positioning of our two main content sections: the logo list and the text content

## Full-page container

🦉 Wrap the entire page markup in a `div` that has at minimum the **full-screen height**, and centers its children with a grid.

💰 Check out the [📜 min-height](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/min-height)
and [📜 Place-items (Grid)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/place-items#center) Tailwind docs if needed!

## Layout grid

🐨 Wrap the markup once again, to create another grid which will be the common parent to both the logo list and the text content.

👨‍💼 Here are some aspects of this wrapping inner `div` you should make sure are covered:

- it's a `Grid` that contains two children (grid cells)
- the `gap` should be set according to the Figma design
- the horizontal and vertical padding should be set according to the Figma design
- handle horizontal and vertical padding (see Figma)
- children should be centered on both axes

💰 Just sharing the [📜 Place-items (Grid)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/place-items#center) docs here once again 😉

## Grouping the logo, `h1` and paragraph

🦉 With CSS Grid, we could technically skip this wrapper, but one extra div is not going to hurt anyone, nor be the performance bottleneck of our website.

🐨 Wrap the Logo, h1 and paragraph in a common parent div, so they become one of the layout grid's two children.
