# Text Styles

There are two aspect or "styles concerns" at play here: the alignment of the content, and the typography treatment.

👨‍💼 Make the logo, `h1` and paragraph look just like the mobile design in Figma.

## Layout

🐨 Center the three elements horizontally and give their container a max-width of `md`.

🦉 The max-width container technically only becomes apparent at the `md` breakpoint on the design, but adding it here exposes subtle things about centering our text content, so we're adding it early.

💰 You probably want to use [📜 Grid](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display#grid) or [📜 Flexbox](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex) to achieve this centering.

💰 You may still need to center the text-alignment itself with `text-center`.

## Font size and spacing

🐨 Apply the correct font size, weight and spacing to the `h1`, based on Figma.

🐨 Apply the correct text color and decoration to the link, based on Figma.

Don't worry about the hover state for now. We'll take care of these later in the workshop, in the **Interaction** section.
