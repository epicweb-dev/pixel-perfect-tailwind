# Grid Class Composition

👨‍💼 Use the new logo coordinates to place the logos in the correct grid cells.

## CSS Grid cell positioning

💰 You can define what grid column or row an element should be positioned in with the [📜 grid-column-start](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-start) and [📜 grid-row-start](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-start) CSS properties respectively.

💰 Tailwind has utilities for [📜 col-start-\*](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-column) and [📜 row-start-\*](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-row)

## Tailwind "on demand" classes and dynamic styles

The Tailwind Just-in-Time engine, which generates CSS as you need it, [📜 expects to see entire class strings](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#class-detection-in-depth) in your template files.

This means you unfortunately **cannot** use _dynamic_ classes like this:

```tsx
<div className={`col-start-${logo.column}`}></div>
```

As nice as it would be, the JIT engine won't recognise this, and as a result, no CSS will be generated.

## Styles lookup directories

🧝‍♀️ I've scaffolded out some "lookup" objects we'll use to map Tailwind Grid column and row classes in a way that plays nice with Tailwind's JIT engine:

```ts
const columnClasses: Record<(typeof logos)[number]['column'], string> = {}
const rowClasses: Record<(typeof logos)[number]['row'], string> = {}
```

🦺 The two TypeScript 'Records' you see above ensure that the lookup objects have keys that match the possible values of the 'column' and 'row' properties on the 'logos' array.

## Populating the lookup objects

🐨 Add the required keys to the `columnClasses` object to satisfy the type checker.

🐨 Add the required keys to the `rowClasses` object to satisfy the type checker.

🐨 Map Tailwind classes to each possible `logo.column` and `logo.row` scenario.

💰 Remember the `col-start-*` and `row-start-*` utilities I mentioned above? Yeah, these will work great here.

## Composing class strings together

🧝‍♀️ I've also created this "mini clsx" helper function that lets you combine multiple class strings together:

```ts
function clsx(...classes: string[]) {
	return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ')
}
```

🧝‍♀️ Here's an example of how to use it:

```tsx
<div className={clsx('some classes', 'more classnames', 'combined together')} />
```

🐨 Compose the dynamic `column` class and `row` class on the `li` element, using the `clsx()` helper function.
