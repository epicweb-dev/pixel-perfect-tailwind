# Design in The Browser

One of the superpowers of Tailwind CSS is how it enables you to prototype and iterate directly in the browser.

In this section, we'll do just that!

## Redesigning a user profile card

We'll take a user profile card (inspired from the Epic Web Notes App) as our playground for design iteration:

![User profile screen](/user-profile-starting-point.png)

Instead of using a design tool like Figma, we'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes and Intellisense tooling to rapidly iterate directly in code.

## Iterative design steps

We'll break down separate aspects of the user profile card design, and improve them step by step.

Things we'll cover:

- Typography and spacing
- Line length and its impact on readability
- Depth and Elevation
- Alternative header & footer layouts
- Gradient backgrounds

## Ready to rock?

Let's do this!
