				🐨 4. Import the { logos } from the './logos/logos.tsx' file.

					1. Add an `ul` for the logos list.
					2. Iterate over the `logos` array and render an `li` for each logo.
					3. Each `li` should have an `a` with an `href` attribute set to the logo's `href`.
					4. Inside the `a`, render an `img` with a `src` attribute set to the logo's `src`.

				To avoid the images being GIANT, let's add a `className` of "w-16" to the `img`.
