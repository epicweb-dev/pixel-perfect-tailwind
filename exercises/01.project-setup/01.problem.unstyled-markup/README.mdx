# Unstyled Markup

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/pixel-perfect-figma-to-tailwind/project-setup/unstyled-markup" />

👨‍💼 A fresh new project — this is exciting!

## Our starting point

👨‍💼 We've got a mini-headstart, thanks to your co-worker Kellie (🧝‍♂️ hello there 👋)!

🧝‍♂️ That's right! I went ahead and created a new React + [📜 Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) app to get you started. It's already [📜 wired up with Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), so you're ready to start building.

🧝‍♂️ You'll be doing most your work in the <InlineFile file="src/App.tsx" /> file.

🧝‍♂️ I have also exported a series of logos from <InlineFile file="src/logos/logos.ts" />, to help you create the tiles.

## Focusing on content

👨‍💼 Look at the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WVR4uy4alsTwrVTc-1) and try to ignore the design for a moment. Isolate the content, and try imagine how you would organise this information in a Word document, in plain text.

🦉 Reasoning about a website's content as an unstyled document is good practice, and a great way to make sure it makes sense to screen readers and search engines.

👨‍💼 When you're ready, go ahead and write the markup in <InlineFile file="src/App.tsx" />.
