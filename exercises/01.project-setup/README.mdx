# Project Setup

Before putting our designer hat on, we need to take a few steps to make sure our project is set up for success.

## Writing unstyled HTML

We'll start by writing completely unstyled markup, so we have a working baseline. A document that makes sense, even if it was completely unstyled.

Technically, we'll be [ðŸ“œ writing JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx).

But the output in the browser will be HTML.

## Configuring the Tailwind theme

The [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WVR4uy4alsTwrVTc-1) uses some colors, fonts and breakpoints that are not part of the [ðŸ“œ default Tailwind theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).

We need to configure those.

**Remember**: we're going for a "Pixel Perfect" recreation here.

So let's sweat the details from the get go, and align our Tailwind theme with the [_design decisions_ made in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WVR4uy4alsTwrVTc-1).
