# Responsive Animations

👨‍💼 At the `xl` breakpoint, make the animations slide from the right instead of from the top.

## Keyframes definition

🐨 Create a new `slide-left` set of `keyframes`, which is just like the `slide-up` one, but with the `20px` translation happening on the `X` axis.

🐨 Create a new `animate-slide-left` utility so you can apply it to elements.

## Animating elements

🐨 At the `xl` breakpoint, override the `slide-up` animations on the logo, `h1` and paragraph with the new `slide-left` animation.

🦉 Looks like the `animation-delay` sub-property gets reset to its default value (`0s`) when applying the `xl:animate-slide-left` class. Make sure you redefine it at the `xl` breakpoint!
