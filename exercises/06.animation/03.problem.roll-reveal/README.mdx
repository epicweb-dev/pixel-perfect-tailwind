# Roll Reveal

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/pixel-perfect-figma-to-tailwind/animation/implementing-roll-reveal-effect" />

👨‍💼 Time to animate the logo tiles. We wanna go a bit fancy here, to really wow the user as we reveal our art-directed logo grid.

👨‍💼 Make the logo tiles "roll", scale-up and fade in over `0.4` seconds.

## Keyframes definition

🐨 Add one more `keyframes` set in the Tailwind theme. This one should start with...

- a **rotation** of `12` degrees
- a **scale** of `0%`
- an **opacity** of `0%`

...and end with:

- a **rotation** of `0` degrees
- a **scale** of `100%`
- an **opacity** of `100%`

## Custom timing function

🐨 Add a 'roll-reveal' animation to the Tailwind theme. It should use the 'roll-reveal' `keyframes` you just created, and animate once over 0.4 seconds.

👨‍💼 Have some fun with the easing function. There is no right or wrong answer here (well, don't quote me on that when speaking to the designers).

### Cubic-Bézier curves

Instead of basic transition timing functions like `linear` or `ease-in`, you can use the [`📜 cubic-bezier()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#using_the_cubic-bezier_function) CSS function to create bespoke [📜 Bézier curve](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bezier_curve) easings for your animations.

💰 It's very hard to "visualise" what the `cubic-bezier()` function does, but luckily for us, there are some great online tools to help. [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com) is a fantastic example!

### Open Props FTW

Have you heard of [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) by [Adam Argyle](https://twitter.com/argyleink)? It's a fantastic collection of CSS variables for common design properties or "tokens" like `colors`, and `spacing`.

Turns out they have a bunch of `easing` functions as well — we could try one of those in our project!

🧝‍♀️ I've added the 'open-props' npm package and imported a series of easing timing functions in the <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.ts" />:

```ts filename=tailwind.config.ts
import easings from 'open-props/src/easing'
```

🧝‍♀️ You can use one of these to fine-tune the "roll-reveal" animation!

## Animating the logo tiles

🐨 Add the `roll-reveal` animation to the logo tiles.
