# Preparing for the Build

Before putting our designer hat on, we need to take a few steps to make sure our project is set up for success.

## Writing unstyled HTML

We'll start by writing completely unstyled markup, so we have a working baseline. A document that makes sense, even if it was completely unstyled.

Technically, we'll be [📜 writing JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx).

But the output in the browser will be HTML.

## Configuring the Tailwind theme

The Figma design uses some colors, fonts and breakpoints that are not part of the [📜 default Tailwind theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).

We need to configure those.

**Remember**: we're going for a "Pixel Perfect" recreation here.

So let's sweat the details from the get go, and align our Tailwind theme with the _design decisions_ made in Figma.
