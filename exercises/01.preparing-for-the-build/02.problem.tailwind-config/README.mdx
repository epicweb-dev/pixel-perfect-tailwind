# Tailwind Config

🦉 Tailwind has a fantastic [📜 default theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) — you can build a surprisingly large number of project without ever deviating at all from those defaults.

In this particular workshop design though, there are a few new design values that land outside of Taliwind's defaults.

## Tailwind theme customisation

👨‍💼 The [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WVR4uy4alsTwrVTc-1) contains a handful of traits that are not part of the default Tailwind theme. They were kind enough to communicate some of these custom values in Figma, so make sure you honour that by transposing all those custom values to the Tailwind theme:

- a custom font family called Poppins (Google font)
- custom min-widths for the `sm` (`520px`) and `lg` (`976px`) **breakpoints**
- custom `4.5xl` and `5.5xl` **font sizes** for the heading tag
- a custom `highlight` color of `#6202FF`

🧝‍♂️ I went ahead and added the necessary Google Font tags in <InlineFile file="index.html" /> for the Poppins font. It's ready to be wired with Tailwind!

## Time to get to work

🐨 Implement the custom **font family**, **breakpoints**, **font sizes** and **color** in the Tailwind theme. <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.ts" />

🐨 Add the `font-poppins` class to the `body` tag in <InlineFile file="index.html" />

💰 Tip: make sure you include the `index.html` file in the Tailwind config's [📜 content array](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration), since it's now using Tailwind classes!

🐨 In <InlineFile file="src/App.tsx" />, wrap the word "Epic" in the `h1` tag inside a `span` with a `text-highlight` classname, to check if the `highlight` color works.
